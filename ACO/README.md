## ACO for path finding

### Description

This project is about implementing the ACO (Ant Colony Optimization) algorithm in order to do path finding in a maze. 

Running the main method inside `main.py` will run the ACO algorithm for 3 types of maze difficulty (easy, medium, hard), and save the path to get out of the maze in a `shortest_route_{difficulty}.txt` file.

**Libraries used:** numpy.
